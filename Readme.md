# Password_Strength_with_Neural_Networks
In my old project I used machine learning algorithms to predict the password strength entered by user, but I was getting around only 84% accuracy. In this project I used Artificial Neural Networks from Tensorflow package to predict the same
and I got almost 100% accuracy all the time. The model is deployed at my portfolio website vasudeogaichor.pythonanywhere.com
